Welcome to the repository of our group "Pandemic Package", a project in the course *Artificial Intelligence in Service Systems - Applications in Computer Vision* that took place during the summer term 2021 at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. This repository includes an object detection application for damages of packages based on state-of-the-art object detection frameworks. It is geared towards deployment on a Jetson Nano for on-edge inference.
